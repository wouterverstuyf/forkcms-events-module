forkcms-events-module
=====================
This module was originally started by .... ? (can find the original repo anymore, anybody?).
The module is still in maintenance, and will be used on a project in development. If the project is ready I will add it, so you have a demo.

Some properties:
- categories
- calendar overview (with next/previous year/month)
- detail page for an event

Possible expansions:
- subscribe for a event (with cronjob if the event is passed)
- now the events will be displayed based on the start date, make it possible to stretch a event on multiple days
- repeating events
